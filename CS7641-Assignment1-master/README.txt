Dear TAs,

All codes were uploaded to the following github repository and complied successfully with python 2.7.

https://github.com/CloudRidingCavalier/CS7641-Assignment1

Copying HW1_Dataset1.py, HW1_Dataset2.py and winequality-red.csv to the same folder, and carrying out the following commands will obtain all data and figures reported in zfu66-analysis.pdf:

python HW1_Dataset1.py
python HW1_Dataset2.py

If the above methods do not work, please load HW1_Dataset1.ipynb and HW2_Dataset2.ipynb to your jupyter notebook and perform the codes line by line. Feel free to contact me if you have further questions.

Thanks,

Zheng Fu
